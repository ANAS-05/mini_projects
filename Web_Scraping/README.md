# OU Results Web Scraping Project

## Description
This project involves web scraping of OU (Osmania University) results using Python and BeautifulSoup. The script extracts and displays the results from the university's official website.
Additionally, I utilized Matplotlib for plotting the results data, allowing for a visual representation of the scores and trends. This integration not only enhances data analysis but also provides a clearer understanding of the results. By combining web scraping with data visualization, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive tool for academic performance analysis.
